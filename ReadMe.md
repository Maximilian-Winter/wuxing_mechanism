# WuXing Mechanism Framework

A framework for identifying and leveraging strategic mechanism points in neural networks based on Wu Xing (Five Elements) philosophy.

## Overview

The WuXing Mechanism framework helps identify critical parameters in neural networks where minimal intervention can produce maximal effects. It's based on the ancient Chinese concept of "得机" (dé jī) - finding and seizing the optimal mechanism point for strategic intervention.

## Features

- Analyze neural networks using the Five Elements framework (Water, Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal)
- Identify mechanism points where minimal changes have maximal impact
- Design strategic interventions aligned with desired outcomes
- Visualize model state and evolution during optimization
- Adapters for different model architectures and tasks
- Integration with standard PyTorch training loops
